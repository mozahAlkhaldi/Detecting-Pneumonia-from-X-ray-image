# Automated Detection of Pneumonia
## Introduction:
Pneumonia is one of the most common respiratory infections, affecting yearly around 450 million people worldwide. Pneumonia can lead to a serious health effect when left undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.
## Project Objective:
Building a model to automatically predict whether a patient is suffering from pneumonia or not by looking at chest X-ray images. The algorithms must be remarkably accurate since it deals with humans' safety and health.
